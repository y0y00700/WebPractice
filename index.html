  <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEB" target="_blank" title="Web specification">Web</a>이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  WEB is a computer programming system created by Donald E. Knuth as the first implementation of what he called "literate programming":<br>
  the idea that one could create software as works of literature, by embedding source code inside descriptive text,<br>
  rather than the reverse (as is common practice in most programming languages),<br>
   in an order that is convenient for exposition to human readers, rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.<br>
  WEB consists of two secondary programs: TANGLE, which produces compilable Pascal code from the source texts, and WEAVE,<br>
  which produces nicely-formatted, printable documentation using TeX.<br>
  CWEB is a version of WEB for the C programming language, while noweb is a separate literate programming tool,<br>
  which is inspired by WEB (as reflected in the name) and which is language agnostic.<br>
  The most significant programs written in WEB are TeX and Metafont. <br>
  Modern TeX distributions use another program Web2C to convert WEB source to C.<br>
